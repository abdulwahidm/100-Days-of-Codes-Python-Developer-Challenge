In Python, a lambda expression is a way to create a small, 
anonymous function. It is a shorthand way to define 
a function without using the def keyword.

The syntax for a lambda expression is:

```lambda arguments: expression py```
The arguments are the input values for the function, separated by commas. The expression is the code that is executed when the function is called. The result of the expression is automatically returned by the function.

Here's an example of a lambda expression that returns the sum of two numbers:

python
Copy code
sum = lambda x, y: x + y
result = sum(2, 3)  # result = 5
In this example, sum is a lambda function that takes two arguments x and y, and returns their sum. The lambda function is then called with the arguments 2 and 3, and the result is assigned to result.

Lambda expressions are often used as a quick way to define a function that is only needed once, for example as an argument to another function that expects a function as input.
